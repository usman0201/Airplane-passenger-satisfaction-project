Title

•  "Airline passenger satisfaction prediction"


Index

• The dataset contians 129880 rows and 24 columns, it is about passenger satisfaction in airlines

• To work on the dataset we used python and excel, python helped in EDA and machine learning

• The dataset was downloaded from kaggle 

• The dataset is downloaded in cvs format which is then imported to jupyter notebook for futher analysis



Introduction- aim of project

• The target variable is satisfaction column which showed if the passneger was satisfied or dissatisfied

• To predict the satisfation of passengers various machine learning classification techniques are used

• The best result is provided by Random Forest Classifier with the accuracy score of 96%	

• In this project random forest was selected because it gave a higher accuracy than other algorithms
